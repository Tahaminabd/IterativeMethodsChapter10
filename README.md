## Introduction
This project aims to provide comprehensive solutions to the exercises and problems presented in Chapter 10 of Yusef Saad's book. The solutions are intended to help students and researchers understand the iterative methods for solving sparse linear systems.

## Content
The repository is structured as follows:

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
- `solutions/`: Directory containing the solution files.
    - `solution1.m`: Solution to the first problem.
    - `solution2.m`: Solution to the second problem.
    - `solution3.m`: Solution to the third problem.
    - ... (Add more as needed)

## Requirements
To run the solutions provided in this repository, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IterativeMethodsChapter10.git
    cd IterativeMethodsChapter10
    ```

## Usage
To run the MATLAB scripts, navigate to the `solutions` directory and execute them using MATLAB:
1. Open MATLAB.
2. In the MATLAB command window, navigate to the `solutions` directory:
    ```matlab
    cd 'path/to/your/IterativeMethodsChapter10/solutions'
    ```
3. Run the desired solution script:
    ```matlab
   - `general_static_pattern_ilu.m`: MATLAB implementation of the General Static Pattern ILU algorithm.

    ```
